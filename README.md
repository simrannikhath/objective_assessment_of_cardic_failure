# objective_assessment_of_cardic_failure
Heart is one of the most important organs in Human's body. In life, some changes may happen that may bring various diseases like, blood pressure, sugar, etc. Similarly, heart failure is also a dreadful disease. Heart failure is a serious condition and there is no cure for this disease. It is a situation in which the patient's heart is not pumping the blood well as the normal heart pumps. Heart Failure prediction is a complex task in the medical field. The rates of heart failure have been increasing day by day as the rate of population is also increasing day by day. This project aims at analyzing the machine learning algorithms based on the percentage of various performance metrics (such as, Accuracy, Precision and Recall). The machine learning methodology will be proposed. It is analyzed using the specific variables in the dataset by using the python programming as well as different supervised machine learning algorithms which include, Decision Tree, SVM, XGBM, LGBM and Random Forest. Anaconda Jupyter notebook is used for implementing python scripting.
